üè° House Price Prediction Using Regression (SAS + Python)
This project applies regression techniques to predict residential property prices using a real estate dataset. Data preprocessing was conducted in SAS Viya, where various transformations (unit conversion, missing value imputation, feature engineering) were performed. The cleaned dataset was then used in Python to build and evaluate two regression models:

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression (degree 2 with log-transformed target)

Model performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Visual comparisons of actual vs. predicted prices validated that Polynomial Regression outperformed the linear model.
The full report, Python code, and SAS preprocessing script are included for reproducibility.
